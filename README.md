### A quality of life addon that helps with handling and processing skill cards.

#### Features:
* Simplify learning and exchanging skill cards with a compact GUI.
* Shows current count for (non-golden) normal and lucky skill cards.
* Buttons to exchange cards more easily (use while skill card npc dialogue is open.) 
* Options menu to customize addon behaviour

#### To install:
Download [AscendedSkillCards.7z](https://github.com/Sigbear/AscendedSkillCards/releases/download/1.1.0/AscendedSkillCards.7z) -> extract the AscendedSkillCards folder and put it in your addons folder.

#### Usage:  
The GUI can be toggled with the command /asc and will by default pop up automatically

| *Any unknown cards will be listed in the gui, so you can easily see and click it* |

### Buttons
There are two buttons available to save some clicks when exchanging a lot of skill cards.  
For the buttons to work as intended **you must have the npc skill card dialogue open when clicking.**

#### Known issues:  
tl:dr reload ui with /rl  
* Occasionally the addon will insist that all of your skill cards are unknown, this is server related and fixed with a ui reload (like most other things)
