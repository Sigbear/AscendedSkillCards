# AscendedSkillCards
### A quality of life addon that helps with handling and processing skill cards.

#### Features:
* Simplify learning and exchanging skill cards with a compact GUI.
* Shows current count for skill cards in inventory (normal and golden, lucky and normal)
* Buttons to exchange cards more easily (use while skill card npc dialogue is open.) 
* Options menu to customize addon behaviour

#### To install:
Download [AscendedSkillCards.7z](https://github.com/Sigbear/AscendedSkillCards/releases/download/1.3.0/AscendedSkillCards.7z) -> extract the AscendedSkillCards folder and put it in your addons folder.

#### Usage:  
The GUI can be toggled with the command /asc and will by default pop up automatically  
As you open sealed decks, any unknown cards will be displayed in a list at the bottom of the GUI which expands as the list grows.  
Left click any of the unknown cards to learn it.

| *Any unknown cards will be listed in the gui, so you can easily see and click it* |

### Buttons
There are two buttons available to save some clicks when exchanging a lot of skill cards.  
For the buttons to work as intended **you must have the npc skill card dialogue open when clicking.**

#### Known issues:  
* Occasionally the addon will insist that all of your skill cards are unknown, this is server related and fixed with a ui reload (like most other things)
* If the addon doesn't show correctly, try /asc reset to reset the position back to the center.
* Any other wonky behaviour is usually solved with a /rl as it could be server related.
