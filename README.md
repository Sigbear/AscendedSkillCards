# AscendedSkillCards
#### A quality of life addon that helps you with the process of opening, upgrading and learning skill cards, by displaying a small GUI, which keeps track of the cards in your inventory.

#### Features:
* When you open a sealed deck the GUI will show automatically and inform you of your current count for (non-golden) skill cards.
* Shows card counter of each rarity so you can easily see if you can upgrade to a higher rarity.
* Option to auto show GUI when opening a sealed deck


#### Usage:  
/asc to show the GUI. Will also pop up automatically if setting is enabled (default).  
Left click any of the unknown cards to learn it.

#### To install:
Download [AscendedSkillCards.7z](https://github.com/Sigbear/AscendedSkillCards/releases/download/1.0.0/AscendedSkillCards.7z) -> unpack AscendedSkillCards folder and put it in your addons folder.

tl:dr reload ui with /rl  
* Occasionally the addon will insist that all of your skill cards are unknown, this is server related and fixed with a ui reload (like most other things)
